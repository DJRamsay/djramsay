## Hi there 👋
My name is Dean and I am a 3rd year  Bsc Computer Science Student at the University of Pretoria.
- 🎯 My current goal is to put more of  my projects that can be made public on github as much of my work has been done in private repos.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a simple Garmin watch application for hangboard training for rock climbing (my favourite pastime activity 🧗).
- 🌱 I recently developed and delpoyed a full-stack website for a local restraunt to manage online bookings, check it out [here](https://www.33onbond.co.za/).
- 📈 I’m looking to collaborate and work on fintech projects that apply modern technologies solve finacial isues.
